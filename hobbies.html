                <h3>Violin</h3>
                <p>I began playing the violin at the age of 7 under the guidance of Mr. Hashemi, a dedicated and inspiring teacher. Over the past 14 years, I have honed my craft through continuous practice, performances, and a deep passion for music. Throughout my journey, I have had the opportunity to perform in numerous concerts, including the Palladium Concert Hall in Tehran. Today, I am proud to call myself an expert violinist, with a strong foundation in both technique and musical expression.</p>

                <h3>Orchestra</h3>
                <p>The Pars Orchestra, founded in 1990 by Naser Nazar at the Pars Music Institute in Tehran, is dedicated to training young musicians. Known for its innovative teaching and youth performances, it has earned recognition through events like the Fajr International Music Festival and helped establish Iran’s first youth symphony orchestra. I’m honored to be playing in this orchestra.</p>

                <h3>Music Composition</h3>
                <p>I began composing music at the age of 12, and over the past 9 years, I’ve written more than 80 original pieces for orchestra, piano, and violin. My work reflects a deep passion for musical storytelling and a commitment to artistic growth. Two of my compositions have been performed by the Bach Orchestra at the Palladium Concert Hall in Iran, marking significant milestones in my journey as a composer.</p>
